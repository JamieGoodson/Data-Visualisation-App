# Data-Visualisation-App
An Android tablet app that visualises data on global energy consumption. Data is retrieved from The World Bank, via a REST API, and transformed into interactive visual information.

The app is aimed at geography students for them to use as an education tool (where renewable/non-renewable energy is a key topic at GCSE/A-Level).
